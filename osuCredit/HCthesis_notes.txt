CITI training Program

Identify Faculty List

Faculty Interview

Stage 3:

Form 'Thesis Committee' of 3 faculty

Meet to discuss terms of the project:
- thesis must be personalized, is this feasible with this project or data?
- what will be the experimental design/goal/hypothesis?
- what approaches will be used? (consider costs and time)
- what outcome do we expect and what is the significance of this work?
- outline student and mentor responsibilities.
- propose timeline (important: mentors must be able to commit to the thesis defense, the date of which is determined by the timeline).

Once agreement is reached, form HC proposal agreement and timeline (from template)
